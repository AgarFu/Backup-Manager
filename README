			backup-manager


	*    A really simple to use backup manager    *
	

The idea is to specify all the important directories of the system.
backup-manager will generate tarballs (or zipped files) of all the
specified directories.

Archives can be uploaded daily to a list of remote hosts.
Cleaning is done with purging each too old archive according to a 
specified number of days.
