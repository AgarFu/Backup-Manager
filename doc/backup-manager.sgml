	<sect id="scope">Scope of This Document
	<p>
The purpose of this document is to explain how the &bmngr; piece of
software is designed, what he was written for and basically,
how to use it for archiving a given file system.
	<p>
This document is dedicated to all the &bmngr; features and then will
not explain how to use external programms which it could use.
	
	<sect id="who-is-it-for">Who should use &bmngr;
	<p>
&bmngr; was written to be as easy to use as possible, with a
lot of verbosity if needed and fully translated in four languages
(English, French, German and Spanish). A care was given to make it
user friendly.
	<p>
Event though it is an easy tool, using it requires a basic knowledge of
Linux, as well as common tasks performed on Unix systems. Indeed,
&bmngr; is a shell script that may use external programs and
then, using it may require investigation when something goes wrong.
	<p>
Originally, &bmngr; was written for personal purpose, to
archive a Linux desktop machine (hence the ease of use) but it can now
be used for backuping data of several hosts.

<chapt id="main-design">Main Design

	<sect id="main-script">The backup-manager script
	<p>
First of all, you have to know that &bmngr; was designed to be
run daily, for instance by <package>cron</package>. In this way, it
can make daily archives, cleanup the archive repository and
eventually, upload the generated archive to a remote hosts.
	<p>
The <prgn>backup-manager</prgn> main script, will take a list of optional
arguments, and will read a configuration file where some special keys
are defined.
	<p>
According to the arguments list and to the configuration file which
are concerned, &bmngr; will perform a set of task. We will
explain in details in this document how the use of both arguments and
configuration file can let you make &bmngr; do what you want.
	
	<sect id="configuration">The Configuration File
	<p>
The first place you should look at when you just have installed
&bmngr; is the configuration file, which should be 
<file>/etc/backup-manager.conf</file>. 
	<p>
This file will be read by &bmngr; at its startup time in order to load
a <em>context</em>. You can run one &bmngr; process per configuration
file at a time, a lock system is used to prevent you overriding this.
	<p>
On the other hand, you can use as many configuration file as you want
and process them at the same time.

	<sect id="externals">External Programms
	<p>
Some tasks &bmngr; can perform are done with using external programms,
you should first be sure that the corresponding programms is well
isntalled and configured on your system before using the related
&bmngr; feature.

The external programms that may be used by &bmngr; according to
context you give it are:

<list>
	<item><prgn>backup-manager-upload</prgn>: This program is a tool 
	provided with the &bmngr; distribution in order to perform file 
	transferts, either with ftp accounts or scp ones. See its
	manpage for details.
	</item>

	<item><prgn>tar</prgn>: As a matter of fact, &bmngr; will have 
	to generate some tarballs, for doing this it will obviously use 
	the <prgn>tar</prgn> program.
	</item>

	<item><prgn>zip</prgn>: If you choose to make zip archives
	instead of tarballs<footnote> You can make <file>tar</file>,
	<file>tar.gz</file> or <file>tar.bz2</file> archives with the
	<prgn>tar</prgn> program.</footnote>, this programm will be
	used.
	</item>

	<item><prgn>mkisofs</prgn> and <prgn>cdrecord</prgn>: If you
	choose to enable the automatic burning system, you will have
	to make sure that those tools are installed on your box.
	</item>
</list>
