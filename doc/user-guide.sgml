	<sect id="scope">Scope of This Document
	<p>
This user guide has been written for everyone who want to use &bmngr; 
for archiving data. Reading this documentation should provide 
all the information a user could ask for. If you find a point that is not
detailed in this documentation, please report it to &doc-email;. 
	<p>
As &bmngr; is a sysadmin tool, the wording <em>User</em> in the title of this
documentation could be understood by <em>a system administrator who want to use
&bmngr;</em>.  This guide will explain you the global design of &bmngr; as well as
every important features this tool provides. 
	<p>
To begin with, the chapter you are reading, <em>Before We Start</em>, is an 
introduction to the understanding of this tool, explaining how &bmngr; came, 
why it was written as there was yet a lot of backup tools and what you need 
if you want to use it at its full capacities.
	<p>
Then, you will have a global description of the <em>Main Design</em> of the program,
explaining what are the ideas behind the code, how the tool behaves
and what are the kind of features you can expect from it.
	<p>
When the main design would be clear to your mind, you will be interested in
learning how you can precisely configure the tool in order to use a given
feature, this will be detailed in the next part <em>Managing Configuration
Files</em>.
	<p>
At this point, the next chapter, <em>Examples</em>, will give a set of precise
configuration files that can be used to provide a particular archiving strategy.
Most of those examples are taken from the real life, thanks to &bmngr; users. If
you think the way you use &bmngr; should be quoted here as an example, feel free
to submit it to &doc-email;.
	<p>
You will also find at the end of this documentation, an appendix which will
describe all the configuration keys you can use in a &bmngr; configuration file.

	<sect id="history">Some History
	<p>
The first thing to explain before entering the technical part of this documentation
is to underline why &bmngr; was written. Indeed, when it came on the Open Source
scene, there were still several backup tools, all of them powerful, well known
and appreciated by users. So why having re-invented the wheel? Was there really
a need for another Linux Backup Tool? I thought so, and I will tell you why.
	<p>
All began when I wanted to archive my important data at home, there were some
important directories I wanted to backup and I then first wrote a small shell
script that did the job. It was small, dirty and really not portable, but it was
a simple script to do a simple thing: generating a couple of tarballs.
	<p>
One day, I don't know why, but I decided to host my webpage at home, I had a
small Linux box with a permanent Internet access and a public IP address so it
was possible and I did it. You can imagine that from that day, my backup strategy 
grew up and thus my backup script needed to be upgraded. I had then two boxes: the server
and my desktop machine. I then realized that I had to make a choice: using a
<em>real</em> backup tool or enhancing my own script to make it well written,
and easy to maintain. I choose the second alternative for only one reason: I did
not find any backup tool that could fit my needs without requesting me to learn
a lot of documentation, installing a server and a couple of agents or even hack a
configuration file that is hundreds lines long.
	<p>
In short, there wasn't any <em>easy-to-use</em> backup tool, and I wanted to
write it.

	<sect id="why-using-it">Why Using &bmngr;?
	<p>
&FIXME;
	<p>
&bmngr; is designed for a kind of Linux users: those who want a simple
tool to manage a set of tarballs.
	<p>
Before I decided to write my own backup tool, either it was necessary to use complex tools, 
or it was necessary to write one's own script to handle tar. It's now possible
to use &bmngr; instead of writing your own Shell script and learning how to use
it won't take you more time than writing your own backup tool.
	<p>
As the ease of use was a real aim...

	<sect id="dependencies">Dependencies
	<p>
The very last thing to say before we start is to list all the dependencies of
&bmngr;. Indeed, some actions it can perform are done thanks to well-known
programs. If you plan to use some &bmngr;'s feature; please, be sure that the
corresponding program is installed on your system.

<list>
	<item><prgn>tar</prgn> or <prgn>zip</prgn> are used for generating the
	archives according the filetype you choose. Be sure to have it when you
	choose the filetype of the archives.
	</item>

	<item><prgn>mkisofs</prgn> is used for building the ISO image for
	burning the data on a CDR/CDRW media.
	</item>
	
	<item>
	<prgn>cdrecord</prgn> is used for using your CDR burner. Be sure that 
	your device is available in cdrecord else, obviously, &bmngr; won't be
	able to burn data.
	</item>
</list>

	<p>
All the internationalization efforts have been possible thanks to
<prgn>gettext</prgn>, so be sure to have it on your system and to use a
supported locale<footnote>French, German and Spanish locales are supported in
the &bmngr-version;</footnote> if you want to have localized messages.

<chapt id="main-design">Main Design
	<p>
Before explaining precise technical points, we will describe the main ideas that
led to the current implementation of the tool. 

	<sect id="what-acrhive">What's an Archive
	<p>
An archive is obviously either a tarball or a zip file, it is a backup of a part
of your filesystem. For instance, archiving the <file>/home</file> directory
could be made in a file like the following: <file>home.tar.gz</file>. This is
what we'll call an <em>archive</em> in this dcumentation.

	<sect id="archive-repo">The Archive Repository
	<p>
We need a place to keep all the archives we generate.
