backup-manager uses backup-manager-upload for uploading files.
Although backup-manager is run by root (from crond), backup-manager-upload
will be launched with the upload user you choose. this means that the user 
should exist on both remote and local machines.
Keep that in mind when editing the ssh authorized keys on remote hosts.

will try to burn the archives after generating it.
