.SH SYNOPSIS
  backup-manager [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a smart tool written in Bash and Perl to provide an easy way for 
backing up local directories.
.P
All the behaviour of the tool will be determined by configuration files, 
default one is /etc/backup-manager.conf.
All the configuration keys located in the configuration file can tune the
way backup-manager will work.
It is able to make tarballs in tar.gz, tar.bz2, tar and zip format, upload
them to remote hosts using FTP or SSH, burn them to CDR/CDRW automatically
using mkisofs and cdrecord.

keys on your ssh accounts if you use this transfer mode.
.P
Backup manager uses backup-manager-upload for uploading files.
Although backup-manager is run by root (from crond), backup-manager-upload
will be launched with the upload user you choose. This means that the user 
should exist on both remote and local machines.
Keep that in mind when editing the ssh authorized keys on remote hosts.
.SH BURNING SYSTEM
If the BM_BURNING configuration key is set to "yes", backup-manager
will try to burn the archives after generating them.
.SH NOTES
On debian systems the best way to configure backup-manager is to use dpkg-reconfigure,
but you can also edit the configuration file by hand.
